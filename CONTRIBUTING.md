## Branch Naming Convention
We follow a specific naming convention for branches to maintain clarity and organization

|Prefix|Purpose|
|:-:|:--|
|`bugs/`|Bug fixes|
|`features/`|New features|
|`refactor/`|Code refactoring|
|`hotfix/`|Urgent critical fixes|

## Branch Naming Guidelines
- Specify what feature or bug is being addressed
- Use lowercase with hyphens to separate words
- Clearly identify the specific component, feature, or issue
- Avoid using issue numbers in branch names

## Branch Examples
Here are some examples of properly named branches

|Type|Branch Name|
|:-:|:--|
|Bug fix|`bugs/login-timeout`|
|New feature|`features/peer-connection`|
|Refactoring|`refactor/state-management`|
|Hotfix|`hotfix/session-hijacking`|
